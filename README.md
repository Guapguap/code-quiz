## Description

Here is a short description about my thoughts looking into this project.

<strong>What was your motivation?</strong>
<br>
    -The main motivator when completing this was the challenge I set for myself to write it only/mainly using jquery.
<br>
<strong>Why did you build this project?</strong>
<br>
    -This project was my first attempt at utilizing my knowledge of everything that I have learned so far in the class. With no code, I had to make my html, css, and javascript page while making them work cohesively. I built this with the idea that I could make an application from scratch.
<strong>What problems did I encounter?</strong>
<br>
    -First main problem I encountered was when I was trying to cycle through the index of question titles and choices. I console logged it and found out that the index was incrementing but my question and choice text was not rotating on the page. I solved the title issue by invoking the startQuiz function again which switched the text, but presented me with a new problem. My li of choices were appending to the board but not replacing the olds ones. I thought back to my password generator assignment where I was dealing with a similar problem. I found out to add a line of code that corrected the issue when also invoking the startQuiz functio again. My last problem was defining the value from the user input after submitting. I was able to do a temporary fix by converting my jQuery language to JavaScript.
<br>
<strong>What did you learn?</strong>
<br>
    -I learned a lot more about all the languages I have learned so far. My understanding overall for coding has increased. A lot of problems that I was presented, I learned how to embrace the challenge and learn for future projects how to resolve similar issues.
